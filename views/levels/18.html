<h1>Level 18</h1>
<p>Lets work with For loops in this level. For loop has a different syntax to be followed, it works with something called as iterator.</p>
<p>Before diving into an example let me introduce you with a function called range.</p>
<p>This function can take upto 3 parameters.</p>
<pre><code>range(x,y,z)</code></pre>
<p>It returns numbers that start from x and goes on till y excluding y and skips z numbers.</p>
<p>For instance, range(0,10,3) would give 0,3,6,9</p>
<p>If only single parameter is passed it return numbers from 0 to that number excluding the said parameter. For example, range(5) would give 0,1,2,3,4</p>

<p>Taking an example of for loop now.</p>
<pre><code>>>> for x in range(5):
...     print(x)
...     
0
1
2
3
4
>>> for x in range(0,50,5):
...     print(x)
...     
0
5
10
15
20
25
30
35
40
45</code></pre>

<p>Here x is the iterator.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> for loops do not require any update statements.</p>
<p>Now letâ€™s try to solve the example which we took in the previous level using for loop.</p>
<pre><code>def sumList(listSalaries):
    sum = 0
    for x in range(len(listSalaries)):
        sum = sum + listSalaries[x]  
    return sum</code></pre>


<p>for loops also provides a more convenient way to solve such problems of iterating through a list of items.</p>
<pre><code>def sumList(listSalaries):
    sum = 0
    for x in listSalaries:
        sum = sum + x 
    return sum</code></pre>
<p>The iterator is assigned values from the list directly.</p>
