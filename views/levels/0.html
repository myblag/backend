<p>Welcome to The Girl Code! I’m Ada Lovelace, chief scientist on the Analytical Engine Project (or AEP for short). The AEP is one of the fastest supercomputers ever! I have called you here to seek your assistance. I am close to completing my work, but I have found it is always useful to have another set of keen eyes on a project. As we build the Analytical Engine together, I will help you to code in Python, solve puzzles, and navigate challenges. In exchange, you can help me build my machine. It is going to start off simple but will become more and more difficult as you progress. Though, I think you can handle the challenge! Maybe towards the end you can help me figure out the parts I have been struggling with myself.</p>

<p>As we go along, you’ll see that some of the words are highlighted. If you drill into the words by clicking on them, I’ll explain them to you. Try clicking on this next highlighted word as an <span id="w1">experiment.</span> <span id="p1">Good job! You’ve opened up an explanation for the word experiment. Experiments are activities that let you test what you think you know against what really happens. Every time you run a program, you are conducting a little experiment.</span> Oftentimes scientists make <span id="w2">hypotheses</span> to guide their experiments. <span id="p2">Wow, you’re terrific at asking for clarification! A hypothesis is an informed guess about how a system works or an event will unfold. When you think your code is going to run after you review it, you are making a hypothesis.</span></p>
